## To-Do 
- Implement an LSTM to see if performance improves. 
- Convert notebook code into `.py` executable files. 
- Export model and make a runner file in which a user can upload an audio file and have a result returned. 
- Someday: connect the exported model to a microprocessor (i.e. Raspberry Pi).
